  <h3>Contributions</h3>
  <p>Open Source module development for CMSMS is pretty much a volunteer commitment. The developer commits the time he can spare to the projects he considers important to the future of the greater project that CMSMS is. Sometimes what one believes is important is not convergent with what the community believes to be important. Sometimes it's a wakeup call and the developer embraces some of the community's vision, sometimes both visions are not compatible. It's a balance difficult to achieve, but brings more responsibility to the developer. But also requires some empathy from the community. And time...</p>
  <p>Please keep in mind that developers do have their daily jobs which means that feature requests are considered and done as time allows. If you need a feature really badly consider contacting one of the developers for a sponsored development.</p>
  <p>Another way that 'kicks the can' forward while motivating the module developer is to sponsor features that web developers would like to see implemented. Web developers, more often that not, know what the final client wants or needs and help bridging the gap between the final user and the original creator of the modules. Keep in mind that modules, more than the CMSMS core, are particularly apt to cover sites special needs, the core being the support around which all things are possible. So, if see the need for a particular feature in an existing module, or a bespoke module for a special need, see if the final customer can fit in the budget the sponsorship of that project. Ask a developer or the actual module developer if its a module feature that is requested, for an estimate for the job and try to make it possible. Sometimes it may be cheaper than it looks, other times it may be possible via some sort of crowd funding. When it happens, it's a win-win situation. The community wins, the web developer wins, the client wins, CMSMS wins and the module developer wins.</p>
  <p>A different way that helps too: found a bug? file a bug report. But please, be as thorough in the description of the bug, the circumstances and environment where it happened and the steps to reproduce it; if the developer can't reproduce the bug it will be difficult, if not impossible, to fix it: as far as the developer is concerned if it cannot be reproduced it doesn't exist. Better yet, if you know how to fix it, suggest the possible fix. If valid, the developer will surely include it.</p>
